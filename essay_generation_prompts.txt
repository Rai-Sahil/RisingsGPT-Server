Okay, now think about how you would write this {essay_length} word essay using the information, what structure would you use. Help build out a skeleton for the essay. Specifically, use the following suggestions:

- Keep the focus narrow: Rather than writing about broad, global topics, applicants should focus on personal experiences that illuminate their character. COVID-19 specifically is discouraged as a main topic due to its widespread use.

- Be authentic: The essay should highlight traits like energy, resilience, leadership, passion, inclusivity, and unique outlooks. The language used should be authentic and not overly formal or flowery.

- Be creative: The essay should 'show, not tell,' and can employ figurative language to describe experiences. It should also have a clear structure, including an introduction, body, and conclusion.

- Make a point: The essay should deliver a key point or insight about the applicant, alluded to in the conclusion.

Writing guidelines:

- Keep the focus of your essay narrow and personal, illuminating your character through specific experiences.
- Ensure that your essay authentically showcases your qualities such as energy, resilience, leadership, passion, inclusivity, and unique outlooks. Write in your own voice.
- Incorporate elements of creativity, 'showing' not just 'telling' your experiences. Use figurative language where appropriate and maintain a clear structure. Describe sights, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and sounds as you write. You want the reader to be entirely absorbed in the story you are telling.
- Think of the typical five paragraph structure for English papers. Your essay should have an introductory paragraph with a thesis/hook, supporting body paragraphs, and a conclusion that ties everything together. Your story might lend itself to six or seven paragraphs instead of five, depending on where the natural narrative breaks lie, and thatâ€™s fine. Just make sure it has a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Conclude your essay by delivering a key point or insight about yourself, making sure the reader walks away with a strong understanding of who you are."

Okay this is amazing! Almost perfect, finally, I would like you to write with a slighly more humanist flavour. Think of writing with the humour of Kurt Vonnegut, the existentialism of Fyodor Dostoevsky, and the imagination of George Orwell.
